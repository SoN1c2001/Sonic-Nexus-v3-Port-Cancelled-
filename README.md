This project has been cancelled. It could be brought back in the future, but as of now, there's no plans to bring it back. This mod is public as is, no issues will be taken into consideration.

Sonic Nexus v3 Port was a combined effort and merger between my version of a v3 port and LanceReborn's v3 Port. Initially, it was just going to be a straight port of the original game and while that was still always the main goal, the project eventually went to including more as bonuses to the main content from the demo and would be unlocked after playing what the original demo had. The plans were the following:

- Tails and Knuckles as playable characters after you complete Sunset Shore Zone
- A full character and stage select menu based on Retro Sonic's menus
- An options menu where you can swap Sonic's running and walking animations with the ones from Retro Sonic, change Knuckles' glide type (from Leonx254's Knuckles mod), spindash type from Sonic CD, Victory Animations toggle using Retro Sonic's assets, a Sound Test, and a toggle for Sunset Shore Act 2 having a sunset palette instead of it's usual one.
- Retro Sonic's bonus stage
- Fully playable Egg Garden Zone recreation from Retro Sonic as an extra level
- Secret playable Amy that can be unlocked by finding her in Sunset Shore Zone as Sonic
- Elemental shields meant for EGZ (Can be seen in the Test Level in the Bonus section)

Egg Garden Zone is incredibly incomplete as of now and SSZ, while mostly playable, has a few collision issues and entity mishaps that make the stage also incomplete. Menus are also nowhere near finished, so the dev menu is required to choose your character and play the game.

The project unfortunately was cancelled and the decision was made as two other Nexus v3 projects had been completed and released recently, but I figured that it would still be nice to put this repo out there publicly. 


If anyone is interested in continuing this however, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back and helping out with it and overseeing it. - SoN1c2001/Burrotis Man
